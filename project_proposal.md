# Junior Seminar (CMPSC 580) Project Proposal

## Semester: Spring 2024

This document is to contain your project proposal. __As you complete each of the below sections in this document, please be sure to remove all preamble text so that it does not appear in your work.__

## GitHub Handle: Add Your Name Here

## Name: Add Your Name Here

## Major: TODO (choose: CS, DS, INFM, SE)

## Project Title: Enter The Name Of Your Project

TODO: Create an interesting title for your proposed project that bring a freshness and excitement to the area of this project. Consider using a name that carries some information about what the project and provides some hint at what the project does without being too wordy.

---

## Introduction

TODO: Introduce the proposed project, providing a concise summary of the project goals, its key elements, offering the reader a quick understanding of the research's scope. The section continues to outline the main topics, research questions, hypotheses, and /or theories in a clear and meaningful language to provide a type of roadmap for the reader to navigate the forthcoming details of the project. This section also needs to motivate the project by providing context for the study, outlining the current state of knowledge in the field, and highlighting any gaps or limitations in existing research. The section serves as a foundational guide that enables the reader to grasp the context of the study, in addition to its structure, before moving into a more technically-based discussion in the following sections of the article. In short, the "Introduction" section needs to answer the `what` and `why` questions, that is `what is the project?` and `why is the project important?`

## Literature Review

TODO (10 source minimum, with 5 of those being published peer-reviewed articles): Conduct literature review by describing relevant work related to the project and hence providing an overview of the state of the art in the area of the project. This section serves to contextualize the study within the existing body of literature, presenting a thorough review of relevant prior research and scholarly contributions. In clear and meaningful language, this section aims to demonstrate the problems, gaps, controversies, or unanswered questions that are associated with the current understanding of the topic. In addition, this section serves to highlight the current study's unique contribution to the field. By summarizing and critiquing existing works, this section provides a foundation for readers to appreciate the novelty and significance of the study in relation to the broader academic discourse. The "Literature Review" section further (in detail) contributes to the `why is the project important?` question.

## Prototype

TODO: Discuss the methods of the project to be able to answer the `how` question (`how was this project completed?`). For this section, you must describe  the methodology behind your implemented prototype. The methods section in an academic research outlines the specific procedures, techniques, and methodologies employed to conduct the study, offering a transparent and replicable framework for the research. It details the resources behind the work, in terms of, for example, the design of the algorithm and the experiment(s), data collection methods, applied software libraries, required tools, the types of statistical analyses and models which are applied to ensure the rigor and validity of the study. This section provides clarity for other researchers to understand and potentially replicate the study, contributing to the overall reliability and credibility of the research findings.

## Preliminary Results and Outcomes

TODO: Discuss the outcomes of your project in this section. Depending on the project type, the presented results and outcomes will vary. In some projects, you will be asked to present a theoretical analysis, and in others your experimental study and its results. In this section, you are also to demonstrate an enhanced version of your artifact by showing its capabilities and applications, in light of the evaluation metrics for assessing the artifact

## Conclusions and Future Work

TODO: Summarize your work and outline future steps needed to complete to take the project to the next stage (for example, if you were to continue with this project in 600/610). You must also address ethical implications of your project, especially as pertains to the public release or use of your software or methods.

## References

TODO: Add references in the [ACM style](https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/reference-formatting). All references must be cited in the proposal.
