# This directory is to store the data necessary for the project.

Use this directory to store a small amount of data which may be used to showcase or demonstrate the use of the project. Please note, due to GitHub's repository size limitations, not all the project's data may be stored in this repository. For projects requiring large amounts of data, it is recommended excessive amounts of data be left outside of this repository, and placed in another type of archive.

Please be sure to reference the project's data and to describe in this README file how to obtain and setup the data so that it may be used
with the project. This information should also be placed in your Method Section.
