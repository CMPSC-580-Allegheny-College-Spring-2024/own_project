# Junior Seminar (CMPSC 580) Own Project Repository

## Semester: Spring 2024

## Final Proposal and Prototype DUE: by 11:59PM on 3 May 2024

This repository contains materials for the proposed project of your own idea, including project proposal with references to literature related to the proposed project, and the implemented prototype with data, if relevant, and all steps necessary to run the prototype. Your project proposal is to be written in the `project_proposal.md` document and must contain all sections provided in the `project_proposal.md` template and described below.

Please make sure that your project relates to your major. Please consult departmental faculty as necessary during their office hours about your project. The following are baseline outcomes/products expected for each major. Computer Science majors following "old" curriculum (academic bulletin prior to 2023), can select a project in CMPSC, DS, or SE areas.

- CMPSC: integration of theory and practice OR integration of hardware and software
- DS: dashboard that utilizes machine learning with big data (application-focused) OR a comprehensive extension of an existing framework of data analysis (method-focused)
- INFM: integration of disciplines (humanities, political/environmental science, or health) with technology AND/OR critical engagement demonstrating the impact of technology in selected area
- SE: working, well-tested, production-quality, deployed software

Double majors need to select a project idea that incorporates both of their majors.

## Timeline

Students are encouraged to follow the below timeline to ensure timely completion of their project. **All students must present their proposed project in class on April 15th and 17th. The pitch presentation slides must be finalized by 1:30PM on 15th April.** The final prototype, including a demo video, and the proposal must be submitted by 11:59PM on 3rd May 2024.

| Week    | Activity |

| 8-12 April | Continue the development of the prototype and proposal writing.|
| 15-19 April | Project Idea Pitches. Prototype evaluation and continue proposal writing.|
| 22-26 April | Project enhancement based on feedback. Preliminary results from the prototype.|
| 29 April - 3 May | Finalize and submit proposal, prototype, and a prototype demo video.|

## Requirements

To complete this assignment, you are required to:

1. complete a proof-of-concept prototype with all source code (and data if relevant) stored in the `\src` directory and submitted in `own_project` repository by  the deadline,
2. create a demo video showing the key  features of your prototype and submit using the provided [Google form](https://forms.gle/7UebHZU4CFzfTrY57) by the deadline,
3. write a project proposal with all sections outlined in `project_proposal.md` completed and submit in `own_project` repository by the deadline,
4. prepare slides for a presentation of the proposed project in [Proposed Project Pitches Slide Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/154V9XquBwLsIVaasJO24e4KglLS9eeVW5e-3mX2OjWc/edit?usp=sharing) before 1:30PM on 15th April and pitch the proposed project to all faculty in the department in class on 15-17 April.

### Prototype

While the proof-of-concept prototype does not have to fully implement the artifact of the proposed project, it needs to contribute to the project goals and it must clearly demonstrate the feasibility of the project. The prototype needs to also produce some results that you can examine and discuss. For example, if you propose a creation of a specific software, your proof-of-concept prototype might implement some but not all of its features. Then, you can conduct evaluation (e.g., testing) and small set of experiments to produce preliminary results for discussion.

### Prototype Demo Video

A 1-2 minute video (in an MP4 format) demonstrating key features of your developed prototype must be  submitted by the final project deadline via the provided [Google Form](https://forms.gle/7UebHZU4CFzfTrY57).

### Project Proposal

The project proposal needs to contain the following five sections: _Introduction_, _Literature Review_, _Prototype_, _Preliminary Results and Outcomes_, and _Conclusions and Future Work_. The requirements of these sections is detailed in the "Assessment" section below and additional information can  be found in the `project_proposal.md` document.

### Project Pitch

Prepare three slides on your proposed project in the [Google Slides Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/154V9XquBwLsIVaasJO24e4KglLS9eeVW5e-3mX2OjWc/edit?usp=sharing). Your presentation should describe your proposed project, its goals and motivation behind it, state-of-the-art in the area of your proposed project, your developed prototype and how it demonstrates project feasibility, and future steps to complete the proposed project.

## Assessment

For specific details about the general evaluation rubric for _minimum

requirements and it is expected that an exceptional project will exceed
these requirements.

    - [ ] The GitHub repository of the project has a passing build status in GitHub Actions
  - [ ] The proposal has the correct format created through the use of Markdown and includes the sections outlined in the provided template
  - [ ] The title of the project is both interesting and appropriate
  - [ ] The project proposal cites at least ten references, with five references being published, peer-reviewed articles
  - [ ] The project proposal consists of at least `2000` words
  - [ ] The project proposal follows a logical flow at the level of sections,
    subsections, and individual paragraphs
